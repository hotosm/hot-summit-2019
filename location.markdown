This year the HOT Summit will be held in Heidelberg, Germany at the University of Heidelberg on Sept 19 - 20, 2019. HOT Summit will be held immediately before [State of the Map 2019](https://2019.stateofthemap.org/). We're working with the SOTM planning committee to coordinate logistics and program details to create an incredible time in Heidelberg. Thank you to GIScience at University of Heidelberg for supporting. 

### Conference Venue 

All HOT Summit sessions will be held on the Neuenheimer Feld campus within the [Chemistry lecture hall building](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/25298676). HOT Summit will use the West and East Lecture rooms along with a smaller lecture room for all sessions. Detailed signs and information will be provided to all attendees.
