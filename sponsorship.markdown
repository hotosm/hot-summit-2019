Sponsorship of the HOT Summit demonstrates your organizationâ€™s commitment to reducing the impact of crises and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals through open map data.

Sponsorship has a direct impact on the ability of mappers from least developed countries to attend, by enabling HOT to provide travel and admission scholarships.

For more details about becoming a sponsor, download the <a href="/downloads/Summit2019-Corporate-Sponsor-Prospectus.pdf">sponsorship prospectus</a>. Email summit@hotosm.org if interested in sponsoring.
