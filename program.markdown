          - people:
              - Catalina Jaime
            organization: Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center
          - people:
              - Stefan Scholz
            organization: German Red Cross
        abstract: "This workshop will present the latest initiatives in the humanitarian sector that are using Forecast-based Financing as well as Impact-based Forecasting approaches to trigger early action. We will have an interactive debate with the audience about how the humanitarian system is moving towards a more proactive and anticipatory type of humanitarian assistance. We will also debate how the HOT community can improve anticipatory approaches, and how we can support the humanitarian sector (and other sectors) to reach at-risk populations, at the right time, before a disaster happens. This way, we can reduce the negative impacts of disasters and assure that readiness for early action can be done systematically through preparedness and risk reduction efforts."

              - Chris Beddow
            organization: Mapillary
        abstract: "Many of the locations mapped for humanitarian purposed rely on local mappers to collect data that is both thorough and accurate. Dense canopy cover can suggest from an aerial perspective that wilderness is on the map, but on the ground, there may be homes, businesses, roads, and more. Capturing street-level imagery presents an efficient and reliable solution. GPS-enabled cameras allow data collection in high detail and wide scale, enabling both local and remote mappers to focus on covering ground so that they can examine the data afterwards. Mapillary will lead this workshop, showing: How dense image capture differs from regular image contribution; How Mapillary imagery and derived data is useful for map editing; How Capture Projects and Mapillary for Organisations can be used to coordinate dense image capture in a specific location; How to choose and use consumer-grade camera and equipment; Methods for overcoming infrastructure and security challenges common in locations where humanitarian mapping is a priority"

            organization: HOT
        abstract: "Computers can efficiently perform multiple tasks at the same time using a detailed set of instructions. However, teaching machines to ‘understand’ the world is not a simple task. This workshop will showcase the basics of computer vision. You will learn how to apply a basic workflow, from describing a digital image, to applying a machine learning algorithm for computer vision on images to detect features such as buildings. We will also show a sneak preview of how HOT is applying machine learning to the Tasking Manager and see how mappers can be assisted with enriched data to create better projects, get the right tasks into the best hands and what user flows will look like. We will also explore how machine learning might be further used for HOT, and humanitarian action in general."

            organization: Aotearoa, New Zealand and UK
        abstract: "Technological approaches tend to be hyped up and wrapped in discourses like ‘innovation’, while missing out on sharing stories of the ordinary, minor, and subtle matters involved in mapping. HOT has a tradition of trying to avoid such traps and do humanitarian work better by helping to democratise, diversify and decolonise mapping. Ethically, we need continue to expand and deepen this practice. But how? This discussion will provide a friendly space for our community to share stories of being a humanitarian mapping volunteer – and the everyday experiences and challenges we face."

        abstract: "Open data and free and open source geospatial technologies from OpenStreetMap, from video to processed satellite imagery tools, enable a more real-time, real-life model to better prioritize, mobilize and monitor cross-sector initiatives. By layering public and private sector data within the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, more impact and community-driven decisions can be made at the local, regional and national level, identifying gaps and overlaps, risks and opportunities. Map the Philippines Inc. (MapPH) has implemented this model in the agriculture, conflict and food insecure areas in Mindanao, to map rural agriculture and artisan infrastructure, study the impact of transportation infrastructure on gender, and analyze container truck logistics to shape public and private sector investment in the region. The next phase involves the transition of local communities into premium and ethical livelihoods in agriculture, artisan trades, tourism and technology."

            organization: Oregon State University
        abstract: "Globally, millions of people are systematically missing in national censuses and representative surveys, and excluded from humanitarian interventions, basic public services, and global settlement and population data sets. This presentation focuses on one category of the ‘Missing Millions’- refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) living in ephemeral or long-term informal settlements. Over the last two years, we have collaborated with HOT to use OpenStreetMap data, satellite remote sensing time series, machine learning, and crowd-sourcing to better place refugee and IDP settlements on the map. This talk will outline the applications of OpenStreetMap refugee settlement data for propelling these components of the Missing Millions project forward, describe successes and identify persistent challenges to mapping informal settlements, and outline next steps in partnering with HOT to co-create a more inclusive settlement dataset."

Organizations with existing mapping initiatives in locations facing humanitarian challenges were invited to participate in the competition. Each participating organization mapped their designated area on OpenStreetMap using street-level imagery and data extracted automatically with computer vision by Mapillary. The winning groups will be sharing their stories and results at the HOT Summit. By leveraging the expertise of local groups, the #Map2020 project areas will be extensively mapped, and the workflow developed will scale to other neighborhoods in the selected city and beyond. "

This is a trusted network of digital volunteers as part of a GO: therefore established and formalized organizational structures, as well as experience and training in civil protection. This presentation will provide a short introduction of VOST, KUBAS (a tool for integration of spontaneous volunteers) and Esri. VOST will share how they have worked with government in open mapping, as well as with trusted volunteers. What can we learn from localization and visualization of social media data and past deployments? It will discuss mapping approaches from ESRI, including the presentation of the Disaster Response Program (DRP) and OpenStreetMap data."

            organization: IMPACT Initiatives
        abstract: "In contexts of crisis, local actors are often the first and primary providers of support for vulnerable populations. However, aid action in contexts of crisis is largely planned and implemented by international actors (UN and INGOs). Developed around national-level coordination structures, aid action often fails to understand and engage with sub-national and local actors. This lack of engagement has repeatedly led to, at best, sub-optimal targeting and duplication of aid efforts and, at worst, an undermining of the role and capacity of local actors.   Under the term “area-based approach”, IMPACT Initiatives aims to leverage synergies between local actors and exogenous aid stakeholders; and the use of settlements as the territorial unit for the planning, coordination and provision of aid and basic services."

        abstract: "To get imagery to mappers in an activation, we have to use satellites in space, but space is hard. Getting pixels to where they’re needed is complex. The imagery-coordination group was made for streamlining and coordinating requests during HOT activations between people on the ground, HOT mappers, and imagery providers. Working together, we make sure imagery flows to the people who need it. Join Pratik Yadav (Imagery team, Mapbox) and Nate Smith (HOTOSM) as they discuss: The imagery business, current players, and the future. How open data is open data? How could it be better? (With examples!) How can people make the most effective imagery requests?"

            organization: Facebook
        abstract: "With AI assistance, Facebook mappers have recently mapped more than 300,000 miles of roads in Thailand in only 18 months, and more than 90 percent of missing roads in Indonesia. Without AI assistance, this would have taken an estimated three to five years longer. Now, Facebook has made this technology available for everyone to use through Map With AI (https://mapwith.ai) and RapiD. The Map With AI service includes access to AI-generated road mappings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, with more countries rolling out over time. The RapiD editor builds on this service. RapiD is an enhanced version of the popular OpenStreetMap editing tool iD designed to make adding and editing roads quick and simple for anyone to use; it also includes data integrity checks to ensure that new map edits are consistent and accurate."

        abstract: "In 2016, HOT began working with global partners on using OpenStreetMap data in malaria elimination efforts. Since then, HOT has mapped over five million buildings in OpenStreetMap in over 10 countries and completed field projects in Botswana and Guatemala with National Malaria Programmes using OpenMapKit. This talk will focus on the next steps in using OpenStreetMap for malaria elimination - how we can overcome the roadblocks we’ve faced so far and the challenges we anticipate going forward. As many organizations are looking towards integrating OpenStreetMap and mobile data collection applications, this will also be an interactive discussion soliciting other individuals and organizations in the field of malaria elimination to contribute their experiences, challenges, and ideas."

        abstract: "When communities experience an emergency, knowing the location of community infrastructure, vulnerable areas, and people will improve disaster planning, response and recovery. Missing Maps is an initiative to build a comprehensive open map of the world by supporting communities in putting themselves on the map. In Summer 2018, the Canadian Red Cross launched a pilot to work with community members in order to assist communities to create and manage digital maps of their area to incorporate local expertise and directly support emergency preparedness using OpenStreetMap. The Missing Maps initiative provides an opportunity to map the large parts of Canada that remain unmapped or poorly mapped. This talk will introduce the pilot, its initial outcomes and some of the challenges experienced when mapping Indigenous communities in OpenStreetMap."
