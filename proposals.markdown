## Call for Proposals is Now Open

The Fifth Annual HOT Summit 2019 will be held in Heidelberg, Germany; September 19-20th at the University of Heidelberg the day before State of the Map-International. This year's theme is: the **Next Phase of Mapping, new ideas in OSM** 

The Summit brings together people from around the world working to make open geographic data available to improve the places they live and work through OpenStreetMap. The two-day gathering will feature interactive sessions and talks from NGOs, international organizations, governments, academia, the private sector, and OpenStreetMap community members. The Summit focuses on how OpenStreetMap is being used to reduce disaster risk and contribute to the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300) that emphasize participation from all sectors of society to meet ambitious targets around the world’s most critical challenges by 2030.

We are looking for unique presentation proposals that engage the audience and create interesting discussions, activities and learning opportunities for Summit participants. We invite you to submit proposals for one of the following types of sessions: 

* **Workshops or training** (1-2 hrs. with group activities/hands-on work)
* **45-minute sessions**
  * Facilitate a session featuring a series of “lightning talks” with 6-7 speakers
  * Partner-up: two or more speakers from different organizations on a common theme/impact area or discussing opposing viewpoints on a topic
  * Debate, interactive discussion or other non-panel format
* **5-Minute failures** (Lightning-talk style presentations of important learning moments in your work)
